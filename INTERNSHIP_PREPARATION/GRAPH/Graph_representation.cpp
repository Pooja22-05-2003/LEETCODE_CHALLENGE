/*

-> In all questions they will tell you 
-> whether graph will be directed one or unidirected one
-> they give u (n nodes  and m edges)
-> In next line they will give u m lines that will represent edges.
-> n and m are independent , m(no. of edges) will not depend on n 
-> n is constant but m can be anything 



-> Que : How to store graphs ?
1. One way is  ADJACENCY MATRIX WAY - Space used (N*N)[Costly thing]
2. Another way is ADJACENCY LIST WAY
